In this directory you will find code designed to make Blaze interact with the
Apache Cassandra database.  Initially it is meant to be used as a read-only
interface, but that could change in the future.

To make the code here to run, you will need pycassa [1], the excellent Python
client for Cassandra, as well as NumPy 1.6 or higher (in the future you
should need Blaze instead).
